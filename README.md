C# implementation of the Monkey language, based on Thorsten Ball's ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/)

## Technology Stack
* C# 7 (Visual Studio 2017, .NET Core 1.1)

Wrote this quite a while ago & need to update it to the latest .NET Core version. Highly recommend buying the book this code is based off of.
